        <h2>Transaction endpoint</h2>
        <p>
          Transactions are created through a <dfn>transaction endpoint</dfn>.
          The transaction endpoint MUST be a resolvable HTTP URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          A server that supports atomic operations MUST advertise this support
          by including a <code>Link</code> header in responses to requests for
          the repository root. The value of this link MUST be the transaction
          endpoint URI. The <code>rel</code> parameter of this header MUST be
          <code>http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/transaction#endpoint</code>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="begin">
        <h2>Beginning an atomic series of operations</h2>
        <p>
          A client begins an atomic series of requests by sending a POST request
          to a transaction endpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is able to create the transaction, it MUST respond with
          a <code>201 Created</code> HTTP status and MUST include a
          <code>Location</code> header whose value is a <dfn>transaction
          identifier</dfn>. A transaction identifier MUST be a resolvable HTTP
          URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          A server MUST also include a <code>Link</code> header in its response.
          The value of this link MUST be a <dfn>commit endpoint</dfn>. The
          <code>rel</code> parameter of this header MUST be
          <code>http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/transaction#commitEndpoint</code>.
          A commit endpoint MUST be a resolvable HTTP URI.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="adding">
        <h2>Adding to an atomic series of operations</h2>
        <p>
          A client adds to an atomic batch operation by including an
          <code>Atomic-ID</code> request header to its request. The value of
          this header is a transaction identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effect of the request, if it has one, and if the request is
          successful, MUST be visible to clients using the same transaction
          identifier as the value of the <code>Atomic-ID</code> header, as
          described here, until the series <a href="#expiration">expires</a> or
          is <a href="#commit">finished</a>. The effect of the request, if it
          has one, and if the request is successful, SHOULD NOT be visible to
          clients not using that transaction identifier. The effect of the
          request MUST NOT be durable unless and until the series is
          successfully <a href="#commit">finished</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the request is successful, the server MUST include an
          <code>Atomic-ID</code> response header whose value MUST be the current
          transaction identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the transaction identified by the <code>Atomic-ID</code> header is
          invalid for any reason, the server MUST NOT update any resources, and
          it MUST respond with a <code>409 Conflict</code> HTTP status. The
          server MAY also include more information about the reason for
          rejecting the request in the response body.
        </p>
        <p>
          A server MAY choose to reject certain operations it normally supports
          when it receives those requests with an <code>Atomic-ID</code>. If
          this is the case, the server MUST respond to those requests with a
          <code>403 Forbidden</code> HTTP status. The server MAY also include
          more infromation about the reason for rejecting the request in the
          response body.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="expiration">
        <h2>Expiration</h2>
        <p>
          An implementation MAY enforce automatic expiration for an atomic
          series of requests.  If so, the response to any request made as part
          of the series MUST have a <code>Atomic-Expires</code> header with the
          HTTP datetime at which the series will expire.
        </p>
        <p>
          An implementation SHOULD extend the lifetime of a series upon the
          receipt of any request to resources within the scope of the
          transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          An implementation SHOULD permit extending the lifetime of a series by
          a <code>POST</code> request to the transaction identifier URI.
          If an implementation supports extending the lifetime of a series, and
          is able to successfully update the transaction, it MUST respond with a
          <code>204 No Content</code> HTTP status. It MUST also include an
          <code>Atomic-Expires</code> header in the response with the new HTTP
          datetime at which the series will expire.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server supports extending the lifetime of series in general,
          but is unable to do so for a particular instance, it MUST respond with
          a <code>409 Conflict</code> HTTP status. The server MAY also include
          more information in the body of the response describing the reason for
          not extending the lifetime of the transaction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="commit">
        <h2>Committing a series</h2>
        <p>
          A client finishes an atomic series of requests by sending a
          <code>PUT</code> request to the commit endpoint for the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effects of all requests in the series MUST become durable and MUST
          become visible to all clients. The transaction identifier of the
          series MUST be expired and MUST NOT be reused.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is able to successfully complete this request, it MUST
          respond with a <code>2xx</code>-series HTTP status.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is unable to successfully complete this request, it MUST
          respond with a <code>409 Conflict</code> HTTP status.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="abort">
        <h2>Aborting a series</h2>
        <p>
          A client aborts an atomic series of requests by sending a
          <code>DELETE</code> request to the transaction identifier URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effects of all requests in the series MUST disappear to all
          clients, and MUST be durably gone. The transaction identifier URI of
          the series MUST be expired and MUST NOT be reused. In addition, the
          commit endpoint MUST be expired and MUST NOT be reused.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is able to successfully complete this request, it MUST
          respond with a <code>2xx</code>-series HTTP status.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is unable to successfully complete this request, it MUST
          respond with a <code>409 Conflict</code> HTTP status.
