      <h2>Atomic Operations</h2>

      <section id="atomic-operations-introduction" class="informative">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Fedora provides factilities by which to conduct multiple operations
          against a repository in an atomic fashion.
        </p>
        <pre class="http">
          HEAD http://example.org/foo

          200 OK
          Link: &lt;http://example.org/foo/fcr:tx>; rel="[URI TBD]"


          POST http://example.org/foo/fcr:tx

          201 Created
          Location: http://example.org/foo/tx:01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section id="scope">
        <h2>Transaction scope</h2>
        <p>
          Transactions are scoped to a resource and its path-wise children. In
          this context, the resource is known as the <dfn>transaction
          root</dfn>. The URI of this resource is a <dfn>transaction root
          URI</dfn>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="identify">
        <h2>Advertising support for atomic operations</h2>
        <p>
          A server that supports atomic operations MUST advertise this support
          by including a <code>Link</code> header in responses to requests to
          resources that can be transaction roots. The value of this link
          header MUST be a resolvable HTTP URI. This URI is known as the
          <dfn>transaction endpoint</dfn>. The <code>rel</code> parameter of
          this header MUST be [URI TBD].
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="begin">
        <h2>Beginning an atomic series of operations</h2>
        <p>
          A client begins an atomic series of requests by sending a POST request
          to a transaction endpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is able to create the transaction, it MUST respond with
          a <code>201 Created</code> HTTP status and include a
          <code>Location</code> header that contains the <dfn>transaction base
          URI</dfn>. The transaction base URI MUST be formed by appending a
          unique <dfn>transaction identifier</dfn> to the transaction root URI.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="adding">
        <h2>Adding to an atomic series of operations</h2>
        <p>
          A client adds to an atomic batch operation by sending requests to URIs
          that are path-wise children of an active transaction base URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effect of the request, if it has one, and if the request is
          successful, MUST be visible to clients using that identifier to add to
          this series of requests, as described <a href="#adding">below</a>,
          until the series expires or is finished. The effect of the request, if
          it has one, and if the request is successful, SHOULD NOT be visible to
          clients not using that identifier to add to this series of requests.
          The effect of the request MUST NOT be durable unless and until the
          series is successfully <a href="#commit">finished</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the client sending the current request is not authorized to access
          this transaction, the server MUST NOT update any resources, and MUST
          respond with a <code>404 Not Found</code> HTTP status.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the client is authorized but the transaction identified by the
          transaction base URI is invalid, the server MUST NOT update any
          resources, and it MUST respond with a <code>409 Conflict</code> HTTP
          status.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="expiration">
        <h2>Expiration</h2>
        <p>
          An implementation MAY enforce automatic expiration for an atomic
          series of requests.  If so, the response to any request made as part
          of the series MUST have a <code>Atomic-Expires</code> header with the
          HTTP datetime at which the series will expire.
        </p>
        <p>
          An implementation SHOULD extend the lifetime of a series upon the
          receipt of any request to resources under the transaction base URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          An implementation SHOULD permit extending the lifetime of a series by
          a <code>POST</code> request to the transaction base URI.
      </section>

      <section id="commit">
        <h2>Committing a series</h2>
        <p>
          A client finishes an atomic series of requests by sending a
          <code>PUT</code> request to the transaction base URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effects of all requests in the series MUST become durable and MUST
          become visible to all clients. The unique identifier of the series
          MUST be expired and MUST NOT be reused.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="abort">
        <h2>Aborting a series</h2>
        <p>
          A client aborts an atomic series of requests by sending a
          <code>DELETE</code> request to the transaction base URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effects of all requests in the series MUST disappear to all
          clients, and MUST be durably gone. The unique identifier of the series
          MUST be expired and MUST NOT be reused.
