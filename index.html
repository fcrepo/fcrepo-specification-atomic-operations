          Fedora provides factilities by which to conduct multiple operations
          against a repository in an atomic fashion.

      <section id="scope">
        <h2>Transaction endpoint</h2>
        <p>
          Transactions are created through a <dfn>transaction endpoint</dfn>.
          The <dfn>transaction endpoint URI</dfn> MUST be a resolvable HTTP URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          A server that supports atomic operations MUST advertise this support
          by including a <code>Link</code> header in responses to requests for
          the repository root. The value of this link MUST be the transaction
          endpoint URI. The <code>rel</code> parameter of this header MUST be
          <code>http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/transaction#endpoint</code>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="begin">
        <h2>Beginning an atomic series of operations</h2>
        <p>
          A client begins an atomic series of requests by sending a POST request
          to a transaction endpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is able to create the transaction, it MUST respond with
          a <code>201 Created</code> HTTP status and MUST include a
          <code>Location</code> header whose value is a <dfn>transaction
          identifier</dfn>. A transaction identifier MUST be a resolvable HTTP
          URI.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="adding">
        <h2>Adding to an atomic series of operations</h2>
        <p>
          A client adds to an atomic batch operation by including an
          <code>Atomic-ID</code> request header. The value of this header is a
          transaction identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effect of the request, if it has one, and if the request is
          successful, MUST be visible to clients using the same transaction
          identifier as the value of the <code>Atomic-ID</code> header, as
          described here, until the series expires or is finished. The effect of
          the request, if it has one, and if the request is successful, SHOULD
          NOT be visible to clients not using that transaction identifier. The
          effect of the request MUST NOT be durable unless and until the series
          is successfully <a href="#commit">finished</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the request is successful, the server MUST include a
          <code>Atomic-ID</code> response header whose value MUST be the current
          transaction identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the transaction identified by the <code>Atomic-ID</code> header is
          invalid for any reason, the server MUST NOT update any resources, and
          it MUST respond with a <code>409 Conflict</code> HTTP status. The
          server MAY also include more information about the reason for
          rejecting the request in the response body.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="expiration">
        <h2>Expiration</h2>
        <p>
          An implementation MAY enforce automatic expiration for an atomic
          series of requests.  If so, the response to any request made as part
          of the series MUST have a <code>Atomic-Expires</code> header with the
          HTTP datetime at which the series will expire.
        </p>
        <p>
          An implementation SHOULD extend the lifetime of a series upon the
          receipt of any request to resources within the scope of the
          transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          An implementation SHOULD permit extending the lifetime of a series by
          a <code>POST</code> request to the transaction identifier URI.
      </section>

      <section id="commit">
        <h2>Committing a series</h2>
        <p>
          A client finishes an atomic series of requests by sending a
          <code>PUT</code> request to the transaction identifier URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The request body of this request MUST be a JSON document with at least
          the single key `state` with the value `committed`. Implementations MAY
          include additional keys in this JSON document. The interpretation of
          those keys and their values is outside the scope of this
          specififcation. A server MUST ignore keys in the JSON document that it
          does not recognize.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effects of all requests in the series MUST become durable and MUST
          become visible to all clients. The transaction identifier of the
          series MUST be expired and MUST NOT be reused.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is able to successfully complete this request, it MUST
          respond with a <code>2xx</code>-series HTTP status.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is unable to successfully complete this request, it MUST
          respond with a <code>409 Conflict</code> HTTP status.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="abort">
        <h2>Aborting a series</h2>
        <p>
          A client aborts an atomic series of requests by sending a
          <code>DELETE</code> request to the transaction identifier URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effects of all requests in the series MUST disappear to all
          clients, and MUST be durably gone. The transaction identifier URI of
          the series MUST be expired and MUST NOT be reused.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is able to successfully complete this request, it MUST
          respond with a <code>2xx</code>-series HTTP status.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is unable to successfully complete this request, it MUST
          respond with a <code>409 Conflict</code> HTTP status.
