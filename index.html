      <h2>Atomic Operations</h2>

      <section id="atomic-operations-introduction" class="informative">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Fedora provides factilities by which to conduct multiple operations against a repository
          in an atomic fashion. This is accomplished by the use of headers on requests. An atomic
          series of operations should not require any more requests than the same series of
          operations performed non-atomically.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="begin">
        <h2>Beginning an atomic series of operations</h2>
        <p>
          A client begins an atomic series of requests by sending any request to any resource with
          the header <code>Atomic-Start</code>. The server MUST respond by including a header
          <code>Atomic-ID</code> with a unique identifier for the series. The effect of the
          request, if it has one, and if the request is successful, MUST be visible to clients
          using that identifier to add to this series of requests, as described
          <a href="#adding">below</a>, until the series expires or is finished. The effect of the
          request, if it has one, and if the request is successful, SHOULD NOT be visible to
          clients not using that identifier to add to this series of requests. The effect of the
          request MUST NOT be durable unless and until the series is successfully
          <a href="#commit">finished</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="adding">
        <h2>Adding to an atomic series of operations</h2>
        <p>
          A client adds to an atomic series of requests by sending any request to any resource with
          the header <code>Atomic-ID</code> and the identifier for that series. The effect of the
          request, if it has one, and if the request is successful, MUST be visible to clients
          using that identifier to add to this series of requests, until the series expires or is
          finished. The effect of the request, if it has one, and if the request is successful,
          SHOULD NOT be visible to clients not using that identifier to add to this series of
          requests. The effect of the request MUST NOT be durable unless and until the series is
          successfully <a href="#commit">finished</a>. An implementation MUST respond
          to any request with multiple <code>Atomic-ID</code> headers with different values or
          with an <code>Atomic-ID</code> header with a value that has not been assigned to a
          series or that has expired (see <a href="#expiration">below</a>) with a 409 response.
          That response MUST include an <code>Atomic-Invalid</code> header or headers with the
          invalid identifier or identifiers.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="expiration">
        <h2>Expiration</h2>
        <p>
          An implementation MAY enforce automatic expiration for an atomic series of requests.
          If so, the response to any request made as part of the series MUST have a
          <code>Atomic-Expires</code> header with the HTTP datetime at which the series will
          expire. An implementation MAY extend the lifetime of a series upon the receipt of any
          request specifying the unique identifier of that series in the <code>Atomic-ID</code>
          header.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="commit">
        <h2>Committing a series</h2>
        <p>
          A client can finish an atomic series of requests by sending any
          <code>PUT</code>/<code>POST</code>/<code>PATCH</code>/<code>DELETE</code> request
          including both a <code>Atomic-Commit</code> header and a <code>Atomic-ID</code>
          header with the unique identifier of an existing series. The effects of all requests
          in the series MUST become durable and MUST become visible to all clients. The unique
          identifier of the series MUST be expired and MUST NOT be reused.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="abort">
        <h2>Aborting a series</h2>
        <p>
          A client can finish an atomic series of requests by sending any request including
          both a <code>Atomic-Abort</code> header and a <code>Atomic-ID</code> header with
          the unique identifier of an existing series. The effects of all requests in the
          series MUST disappear to all clients, and MUST be durably gone. The unique identifier
          of the series MUST be expired and MUST NOT be reused.
